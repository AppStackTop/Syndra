# Syndra

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/laravelista/Syndra.svg?branch=1.0.0)](https://travis-ci.org/laravelista/Syndra) 

Common JSON responses for an API built with Laravel 5.1.

## Installation

First, pull in the package through Composer.

```js
"require": {
    "laravelista/syndra": "~1.0"
}
```

And then, if using Laravel 5.1, include the service provider within `config/app.php`.

```php
'providers' => [
    'Laravelista\Syndra\SyndraServiceProvider'
];
```

And if you want you can add a facade alias to this same file at the bottom:

```php
'aliases' => [
    'Syndra' => 'Laravelista\Syndra\Facades\Syndra'
];
```
